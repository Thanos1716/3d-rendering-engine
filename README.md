## 3D Rendering Engine
This is a learning project where I am attempting to implement:
 - A camera
 - Camera movement
 - 3D point/line/mesh rendering (**without** builtin OpenGL/GLFW 3D support)
 - Texture handling
 - HW acceleration (GLSL)
 - Quaternion rotations/transformations
 - Possibly pathfinding

The code here is not written to be fast at the moment, but rather to be understandible.
